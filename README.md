## About Me

This is a rapid development platform based on VUE3 + element plus on the front end and Spring boot and Spring cloud on the back end. The main purpose of this project is to learn the latest Spring technology and use it in action.

The project mainly includes backend data management (**mall management system**) and personal blog website.

The system has built-in various business modules, which can be used to quickly improve your business system:

* Common modules (mandatory): system functions, security solutions, infrastructure
* Common modules (optional): workflow, payment system, data report, member center
* Business system (TODO): ERP system, CRM system, shopping mall system, AI big model
